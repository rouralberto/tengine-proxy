# Docker Tengine-proxy
Automated Tengine proxy for Docker containers with Letâ€™s Encrypt Certificates.

This solution gets the inspiration from `neilpang/nginx`. Instead of using Nginx, it sports an improved fork
called *Tengine*, which is Nginx with super-powers.

## Libraries
- `tengine` as proxy server
- `docker-gen` to gather metadata from other containers
- `shoreman` to run the `Procfile` services
- `acme.sh` to manage the SSL certificates

## Usage
### docker run
In the simplest of usages, just
run `docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro roura/tengine-proxy`.

### docker-compose
If you want to run it with `docker-compose` alongside another project:
```yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  proxy:
    image: roura/tengine-proxy
    network_mode: bridge
    container_name: proxy
    restart: on-failure
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    #- "443:443"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro
      - ./proxy/certs:/etc/nginx/certs
      - ./proxy/acme:/acmecerts
      - ./proxy/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
  web:
    image: httpd
    network_mode: bridge
    container_name: httpd
    restart: on-failure
    environment:
      VIRTUAL_HOST: httpd.docker
      #ENABLE_ACME: "true"
```

## Options
### Virtual Hosting
Set `VIRTUAL_HOST` as environment variable on the containers you want proxied, like `VIRTUAL_HOST: sub.domain.org`.
If the container can be called using multiple hostnames, just separate them with a comma.

If your application runs in a port other than *80*, then set the `VIRTUAL_PORT` variable to the port.

### Auto-SSL Management
Set `ENABLE_ACME: 'true'` so the proxy will manage the certificates and the renewals for you using Let's Encrypt.
Please note that this variable needs to be set on the container running the application to get the certificate.
Also, the domain in `VIRTUAL_HOST` needs to be internet-reachable.

## Development
Use the `docker-compose.yml` provided to simplify your development process.
